    This is an XML comment, and it's how we'll be adding comments to your code! Try writing one yourself. You can write these
    to document your decisions, ask us questions, etc. We like to identify ourselves with initials to help keep clear *who* is talking.
     (ajn is Aaron Newton, JMH is Jon Horanic, and ebb is Dr. B)
   To read our comments and see everything, you'll probably want to toggle the "line wrap" feature in oXygen.
   Do this by going to Document, Edit, and select Toggle Line Wrap on the little submenu. 
   Or on your keyboard, you can hold down Ctrl (or Command on a Mac) + Shift + Y. -->

<Recipe_Name>Gazpacho Recipe

 <description>California version of the classic Spanish gazpacho!
     Chilled soup made with ripe fresh tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, celery, and onions.
 </description>
    <Prep_time> 25 minutes</Prep_time>
    <Yield> Serves 8</Yield> 
<Ingredients>
    <ing_1 units="6 cups">6 ripe tomatoes (about 3 lbs), peeled and chopped (yielding about 6 cups)</ing_1>
    <!--2017-08-30 ajn Another way of writing xml in forms of steps in as following:
    <ing n="1" units="6 cups">6 ripe tomatoes (about 3 lbs), peeled and chopped (yielding about 6 cups)</ing>    
    Notice the 'n="1"'. This refers to your first step and then for your next step you could write 'n="2"'. This is good to do becasue later in the course we will teach you how to make the computer count for you.-->
    <ing_2 units="1 1/4 cups">1 red onion, finely chopped (about 1 1/4 cups)</ing_2>
    <ing_3 units="1 cup">1 cucumber, peeled, seeded, chopped (about 1 cup)</ing_3>
    <ing_4 units="1 cup">1 sweet red bell pepper (or green) seeded and chopped (about 1 cup)</ing_4>  
    <ing_5 units="1 cup">2 stalks celery, chopped (about 1 cup)</ing_5>
    <!-- 2017-08-30 JMH ebb: We noticed that after this point, you changed what you included in the @units attribute. 
        Be careful: when creating any element or attribute keep in mind that *consistency is key!*
    A change like this can lead to readablity issues for both humans and computer. 
    We agree, actually, with your later decision to code units as the unit of measure (cups, Tbsb), and even here we would recommend ALWAYS using the same form of the word: "cup" vs. "cups". But we'd write a separate attribute to hold the number as a special piece of information, the quantity, like so: <ing units="cup" quant="1">...</ing> Make sense? 
    Later on when we get to schema coding (next week!), we'll show you how you can control what values you consider "valid" for your XML projects.

    <ing_6 units="Tbsp"> 1-2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley</ing_6>
    <ing_7 units="Tbsp">2 Tbsp chopped fresh chives</ing_7>
    <ing_8>1 clove garlic, minced (about 1 teaspoon)</ing_8>
    <ing_9 units="cups">1/4 cup red wine vinegar</ing_9>

    <ing_11 units="Tbsp">1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice</ing_11>
    <ing_12 units="tsp">2 teaspoons sugar (more may be needed to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes,
    add to taste)</ing_12>
    <ing_13>Salt and fresh ground pepper to taste</ing_13>
    <ing_14>6 or more drops of Tabasco sauce to taste</ing_14>
    <ing_15 units="tsp">1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (omit for vegan or vegetarian option)</ing_15>
    <in_16 units="cups">2 cups tomato juice (or 1 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes if you don't have tomato
        juice)
    </in_16> 
    <!--2017-08-30 ajn It looks like you missed the 'g' in <ing_16>. Be cautious of this, but we'll show you how to ensure consistent spelling of your tags when we get to schema writing soon.-->
</Ingredients>
<Directions>
    <step_1>Place all ingredients in a large bowl.</step_1> 
    <step_2>Use an immersion blender or blend in batches, to desired smoothness. We prefer our gazpacho
        somewhat chunky, so only pulse a few times in the blender.
    </step_2>
    <step_3>Adjust seasonings to taste.</step_3>
    <step_4>Place in a non-reactive container (tomatoes are acidic) to store.</step_4>
    <step_5>Chill several hours or overnight to allow the flavors to blend.</step_5>

    Great use of an XML comment, and also terrific work on your first time coding! We are impressed! Considering we went over this in class on Wed 8/30 we are hoping you have a better understanding of how to work with your attributes. Although your start tag is correct, it doesn't necessarily make sense, since it holds the rest of the text. Try using a tag that is general like '<root></root>' or even '<recipe></recipe>'
    We also recommend not putting numbers in your element names. Why not? Well, each ingredient element is the same *kind* of thing, and a computer can always number more efficiently than a human can! (We miscount all the time...) We'll be learning how to get the computer to do the numbering (usually in attributes) a little later in the course when we're writing XSLT code. 
    This is a great start, especially because it gave us a chance to preview a few neat things we'll be able to do with code over the next few weeks! 
    Score: 8.8/10
